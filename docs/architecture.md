# Architecture

```
Browser ──► frontend (Next.js) ──► backend (Spring Boot) ──► PostgreSQL
            route handlers proxy     /api/v1/*, /health/*
```

## Principles

- **The browser never talks to the backend directly.** Server components and
  route handlers in `frontend/` call the backend using `BACKEND_API_URL`
  (server-only). The backend therefore needs no CORS config and can stay on
  a private network.
- **One response envelope.** Every backend JSON response is
  `{"data": ..., "meta": ..., "errors": [...]}` (`shared/ApiResponse`).
  Errors carry an `errorCode`, a human `message` and the request's
  `correlationId`.
- **Correlation IDs.** Each request gets an `X-Correlation-ID` (the caller's,
  if well-formed, otherwise generated). It is echoed in the response header,
  included in error bodies and printed on every log line.
- **Schema via migrations only.** Flyway migrations in
  `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V{n}__description.sql`;
  Hibernate only validates (`ddl-auto: validate`). Never edit a migration that
  has been merged — add a new one.
- **Tests run against real Postgres** (Testcontainers), not H2, because the
  schema uses Postgres-specific types.

## Authentication

There is one admin account, configured through environment variables
(`ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` — bcrypt). There are no users or roles.

1. `POST /api/v1/auth/login` checks the credentials and returns an HS256 JWT
   (`JWT_SECRET`, valid for `JWT_TTL`). Failed attempts are rate-limited per client
   (5 per 15 minutes).
2. The frontend keeps the token in an httpOnly cookie and forwards it as
   `Authorization: Bearer` on every API call.
3. Everything under `/api/v1` needs the token, except login and
   `GET /api/v1/media/{id}/file` (images are public so published pages can embed them).

## API

All under `/api/v1`, JSON in camelCase, wrapped in the response envelope.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /auth/login` | Exchange admin credentials for a token |
| `GET /posts?status&q&tag&author&sort&direction&page&size` | Paginated list (`meta` holds page info) |
| `GET /posts/counts` | Posts per status, for the list tabs |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /posts/{id}`, `POST /posts` | Read, update (send the loaded `version`), delete, create |
| `POST /posts/{id}/publish` · `/unpublish` · `/archive` · `/duplicate` | Lifecycle actions |
| `GET/POST /authors`, `PUT/DELETE /authors/{id}` | Authors |
| `GET/POST /tags`, `PUT/DELETE /tags/{id}` | Tags |
| `GET/POST /media` (multipart `file`), `PATCH/DELETE /media/{id}`, `GET /media/{id}/file` | Image library |

### Business rules

- New posts are drafts. Publishing requires a title and some content (words or an
  image). `publishedAt` is set on first publication and kept across unpublish/republish.
- Saves carry the `version` the editor loaded; a stale version gets `409 VERSION_CONFLICT`
  instead of overwriting someone else's changes.
- Slugs are unique per resource and derived from the title/name when left empty.
- The post body is Tiptap JSON. On save the backend derives its plain text (for search),
  word count, reading time, and the library images it embeds; links must be
  `http(s)`, `mailto:`, `/` or `#`, and images `http(s)` or `/`.
- Uploads are identified from their bytes (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF; ≤ 10 MB), never from the
  client's file name or Content-Type. An image used as a cover, inline, or as an avatar
  can't be deleted.
- Deleting an author or tag removes it from posts; the posts stay.

## Backend layout

Code is grouped by feature, then by layer:

```
io.atomity.blogcrm
├── BlogCrmApplication
├── shared/            ApiResponse, ApiError, ApiException, GlobalExceptionHandler,
│                      CorrelationFilter, PageMeta, Slugs, Timestamps
├── auth/              config/ (SecurityConfig, AuthProperties) controller/ dto/ service/
├── post/              controller/ dto/ entity/ repository/ service/ (ContentAnalyzer)
├── author/ tag/       controller/ dto/ entity/ repository/ service/
└── media/             … plus storage/ (StorageService, local-disk implementation)
```

Conventions: constructor injection, Java `record`s for DTOs, UUID primary
keys, timestamps as UTC `Instant` / `TIMESTAMPTZ`, REST paths under
`/api/v1/<plural-resource>`.

## Frontend layout

```
src/
├── app/          Routes (pages render a module canvas) and route handlers: api/auth/*, api/v1/[...path] proxy
├── modules/      One folder per feature (posts, authors, tags, media, auth):
│                 *Canvas.tsx screens + api.ts, the feature's only data access
├── components/   Shared UI: ui/ (primitives) and shell/ (sidebar, top bar, navigation guard)
├── hooks/        useAsync, useDebouncedValue, useUnsavedChangesWarning
├── lib/          api-client (browser → /api/v1 proxy), backend + session (server), slug, content, format
├── styles/       tokens.css (design tokens), base, component classes, editor typography
├── types/        Domain types mirroring the backend's JSON (Post, Author, Tag, Media, Page)
└── proxy.ts      Route gate: no session cookie → /login
```

### Data access

Screens never fetch directly; they call functions in `modules/<feature>/api.ts`, one per
backend endpoint. Those go through `lib/api-client.ts` to this app's own `/api/v1/*`
route (`app/api/v1/[...path]/route.ts`), which:

- forwards the request to `${BACKEND_API_URL}/api/v1/*`, streaming bodies both ways
  (image uploads and downloads included);
- turns the httpOnly `blogcrm_session` cookie into `Authorization: Bearer <token>`;
- clears the cookie when the backend answers 401, and the client then sends the browser
  to `/login?next=…`.

`/api/auth/login` exchanges the admin credentials for the backend's JWT and stores it in
the cookie (expiring with the token); `/api/auth/logout` deletes it. `proxy.ts` only
checks that the cookie exists — the backend validates the token on every call.

Post bodies are Tiptap (ProseMirror) **JSON**, never HTML. Images inside a body
carry `attrs.mediaId`, so the backend can tell which library images a post uses.

## Health

Served by Spring Boot Actuator:

- `GET /health/liveness` — the process is running.
- `GET /health/readiness` — the process is running **and** the database answers.
- `GET /metrics` — Prometheus metrics.
